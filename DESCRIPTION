Description: Provide a patch (correction) on degrees of freedom (dof) of MARS 
    We propose an adaptive way to set the penalty factor (and hence degrees of freedom)
    during the model training procedure of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. The
    correction has been shown to achieve a better performance.
