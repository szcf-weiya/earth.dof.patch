# earth.dof.patch

`earth.dof.patch` is an R package providing a patch (correction) on degrees of freedom (dof) of MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), whose R package is called `earth`. The correction has been shown to achieve a better performance, see more details in our paper.

See also: Our Julia package [DegreesOfFreedom.jl](https://github.com/szcf-weiya/DegreesOfFreedom.jl) also provide an implementation on dof of MARS, together with implementations for other classical statistical learning approaches.
